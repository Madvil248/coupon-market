# Momentum React Native Home Assignment

This repository contains the solution for the Momentum React Native home assignment. The project is a mobile application built with React Native (Expo) that guides a user through a multi-step funnel, demonstrating clean architecture, local state persistence, and a dynamic offer flow.
